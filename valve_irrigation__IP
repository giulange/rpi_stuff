# Here I start listing the IPs of the solenoid valve devices used for the irrigation net.
# I decided to assign the series 70's to the irrigation net.
#Â The next step will be to create a script to query the status of devices controlling the irrigation net.

# Here follows the list of valves with associated IPs:
# item       ip            mac-address        device   valve        position
# valve00    192.168.1.70  60:01:94:74:49:d7  nodeMCU  12v          test
# valve01    ...           ...                nodeMCU  4v5          ...
# valve02
# valve03
# valve04
# valve05
# valve06
