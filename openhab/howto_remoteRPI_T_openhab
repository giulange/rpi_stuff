# use as reference the guide in howto_remoteDHT_openhab

# create the script rpi_T__openhab.sh with the following instructions:

#!/bin/bash
INPUT=$(/usr/bin/ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@192.168.1.$1 "/bin/cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp")
echo $INPUT/1000 |bc -l| python -c "print round(float(raw_input()),2)"

# set permissions
chmod +x rpi_T__openhab.sh
sudo chown openhab:openhab rpi_T__openhab.sh

# This must be run as root. It means you have to copy the public key into the remote rpi from which to get the internal Temperature.
sudo su -
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@192.168.1.XXX 'cat >> ~/authorized_keys_tmp'
# go to the remote pi
ssh pi@192.168.1.XXX
# copy the key in ~/authorized_keys_tmp into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
sudo cat ~/authorized_keys_tmp | cat >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# now you can ssh as root

# to run the script from within the rpi hosting the script
sudo su -
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 #if not yet done!
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys # on the same rpi

# install bc, required by the script
sudo apt-get install bc

# test the pi using the local version of the script
sudo ./rpi_T_locale__openhab.sh

# now you can test the remote query:
sudo ./rpi_T__openhab.sh 234

# configure openhab:
sudo vi /etc/openhab/configurations/items/home.items
Number TEMP_rpi234 "Temperature rpi-irc [%.1f Â°C]" <temperature> { exec="<[/home/pi/git/rpi_stuff/openhab/rpi_T__openhab.sh 234:60000:REGEX((.*?))]" }
