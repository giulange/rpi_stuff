# Instructions on how to configure openhab reading RH & T from
# a pi on locale network.

# Follow instructions here :: https://klenzel.de/3100
# use as reference this :: http://b.truzzi.me/home-temperature-monitoring-using-openhab-rpi-esp8266-and-hdc1000/

# install exec binding on pi with openhab:
mv org.openhab.binding.exec-1.8.3.jar /usr/share/openhab/addons/
# the addon will be automatically installed

# addons can be downloaded from here :: http://www.openhab.org/getting-started/downloads.html

# create a script querying the current values of the variables (RH & T)
# I created this one, available on git repo:
DHT_HR-T__openhab.py
# and I set this:
chmod +x /home/pi/git/rpi_stuff/DHT_HR-T__openhab.py
sudo chown openhab:openhab /home/pi/git/rpi_stuff/DHT_HR-T__openhab.py
