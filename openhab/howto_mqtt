# I need to turn lights on/off using a rpi via gpio connected to rele.
# openhab can have an item with in/out-bound messages turning lights on/off
# on a remote rpi, with respect to that hosting openhab.
# To use this option I need to install a mqtt broker on the remote rpi, that is
# the rpi having the connetion to rele and then to lights.

# I need 2 rpi-s
#	rpi#1 with openhab [SERVER] :: 192.168.1.233
#	rpi#2 with mqtt broker (mosquitto) [ROOM] :: 192.168.1.232

# step #01 :: install openhab on rpi#1
#  see instructions in file README-openhab
#  install mosquitto client
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients

# step #02 :: install mosquitto on rpi#2
sudo apt-get install mosquitto mosquitto-clients 


# step #03 :: activate required pins on "ROOM" rpi#2
# *tutorial* :: https://geekytheory.com/tutorial-raspberry-pi-gpio-parte-1-control-de-un-led/
# activate PIN 3: (I tested the rpi<-->rele<-->220v Light
echo 3 > /sys/class/gpio/export
# set as OUTPUT led:
echo out > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/direction
# turn ON led:
echo 1 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/value
# turn OFF led:
echo 0 > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/value
# delete PIN 5:
#echo 5 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport

# step 04 :: subscribe to GPIO topic on rpi#2 [ROOM] 
mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.232 -t "GPIO" > /sys/class/gpio/gpio3/value

# step 05 :: publish to GPIO topic from rpi#1 [SERVER]
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.232 -t "GPIO" -m "0"
mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.1.232 -t "GPIO" -m "1"

# step 06 :: configure openhab on rpi#1
# set broker
sudo vi /etc/openhab/configurations/openhab.cfg
mqtt:mosquitto232.url=tcp://192.168.1.232:1883
# set item with outbound message
sudo vi /etc/openhab/configurations/items/home.items
Switch myFirstLight {mqtt=">[mosquitto232:GPIO:command:ON:1],>[mosquitto232:GPIO:command:OFF:0]"}
# set item in sitemap
sudo vi /etc/openhab/configurations/sitemaps/home.sitemap
Switch item=myFirstLight
