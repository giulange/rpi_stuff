# Notes about how to let rclone work!

1. I configured a dedicated rpi with all external HDDs connected via a powered USB hub

2. I installed rclone on rclone-pi https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-rclone/

3. I continue using previously configured scripts to automate the sync of different servers, /media/TM01/rclone/rclone-pi-stuff/

4. I have to setup servers if not done yet. 
   Configurations are saved by default at /home/pi/.config/rclone/rclone.conf. 
   To set up a new server I need to have a working VNC connection to rclone-pi (see NOTES file related to VNC setup), because the procedure needs to run a browser (I installed firefox) for the authentication process on the servers reported below.
   Connect to rclone-pi via VNC, open terminal and run `rclone config`.
   I repeated the procedure for {dropbox,onedrive,googledrive}. In future I can avoid to 

5. Once I have in rclone.conf all the configurations, I copied it to /media/TM01 HDD for future reference, and for docker reference, in case the rclone-pi SD will have issues.
   /media/TM01/rclone/rclone-pi-stuff/config

6. Install docker-compose on rclone-rpi, https://dev.to/elalemanyo/how-to-install-docker-and-docker-compose-on-raspberry-pi-1mo
```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev
sudo apt install python3-dev
sudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
sudo pip3 install docker-compose
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

7. Run docker compose
```
docker-compose -f /media/TM01/rclone/rclone-pi-stuff/docker_rclone.yml up -d
```

8. goto rclone-rpi via VNC, open internet browser and goto localhost:5572 ––> enter credentials set in yml file (--rc-user giuliano --rc-pass antonietta) twice and join the rclone webapp !

9. You can do the same at http://192.168.1.6:5572

10. add the port forwarding to the home router and use http://rpi-giuliano.noip.me:5572
